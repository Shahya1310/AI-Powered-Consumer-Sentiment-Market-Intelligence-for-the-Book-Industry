read RECOMMENDATIONS!✨📚 #minivlog #bookrecommendations,"Will surely read some of the books you recommend! I recently read the novel ""Allah Miyan ka Karkhana"" by Mohsin Khan, the latest sensation in the literary scenario.  

I sincerely request the you to review this novel, which is available in Hindi, as as I read will come soon in 60 languages including one in English by Harper Collins in English. As I'm interested in reading it in English. You can review it better than me and most i know. The novel has recently been honored with the Bank of Baroda Rashtrabhasha Samman and published by Rekhta.  

Critics have described it as a “mirror” that reflects society’s harsh truths. It poignantly portrays how innocence, especially that of children, is punished, and how injustice against the defenseless continues to thrive. The work raises profound moral and social questions that resonate deeply with our times.  

Your review of this novel would be invaluable for literature lovers and offer viewers a fresh perspective.

if you want to read suspense, read the silent patient, the plot is crazy

read RECOMMENDATIONS!✨📚 #minivlog #bookrecommendations,"Pls read before selecting books as a  beginner :

Scratch this, if you want to get into reading try with small adventure books with a good storyline so you don't get bored and stop reading after a while and start feeling miserable... Later you can slowly explore different genres and authors...I would never recommend you to straight away start non-fiction until you find your preferred genre in books that you can truly enjoy. 

Trust me I started my reading journey with books as simple as Thea Stilton series, Enid Blyton , and Nancy Drew , and now have transformed into a voracious reader of books like A thousand splendid suns, the girl who knew too much , A litte life,kite runner, girl in pieces , Tuesdays with Morrie ,or the colour of water by James McBride, All having equally different and engaging stories.

48 Laws Special Edition #comparisonvideo #48lawsofpower #bookreview #specialedition #books #vs,"Hi again! 😂
So I’m a fan of street side book vendors & have my share of several purchases over the years.  Sometimes  if I don’t find what I want I’m like “fine, I’ll do it myself😼” A random example - several years back, probably a decade or more.. I was sucked into the world of Metro 2033 by Dmitry Glukhovsky while playing the PC game & while wanting to read the English version I just couldn’t find it. 

So just  did what I had to - Put on my 🏴‍☠️hat & searched the seven seas for an .epub then took it straight to a photocopy shop ..paid like dunno 50p/page (got a discount from the high page count needed) , then told the guy to make it into a proper book-like version with spiral binding, 2 sided brochure printing (standard book size) & cover/title page etc .. & in the end had a very nice copy of the book for about 150 😅

Argh, I’m rambling 🙊.. So anyway much, much later I found an expensive limited edition of the same & while holding it ….. I felt it at the moment — the aura, the mana, the power, the solid feels or whatever one may call 😅😂 The golden edge print, the heavy embossing on front & back, the thicccc GSM etc etc❤

So yea, these specialty binded books may in reality be ‘binding’ us to their spells & who can blame them when they look so beautiful huh? 😊

So coming back to this clip - that dual-image edge print of the two finest minds of their times is just brilliant & I have never seen anything like that before , the textured finishes are such nice touches too! 😮❤😎
Congrats on your purchase, keep it safe & away from relatives & friends wishing to “borrow” it, lol 😆",@maxpayne69.,1,2026-01-05T01:38:00Z,youtube

Books I wish I could unread #booktube #booktok #bookish #bookreview #booksummary #reading #bookworm,"MY NEW BOOK HERES A PREVIEW GUYSSS!

     “I can’t breathe!” she said dying of laughter in my arms.  We were just two teens laughing over a stupid video we pulled off of the internet, of an AI cat dancing to a song on top of a cup of hot chocolate.  I know, it seems stupid, but she thought it was funny.  Her laugh made me laugh.  We were . . . laughing . . . living.
Actually, let me introduce who “we” are.
I’m your average teenage boy.  Hoodie, pajama pants, brown straight hair, emerald green eyes and about 5 foot 10.  My name was Levi.  The average name for the most average American boy.  I was in my junior year at Redwood high school, a crappy school that FORCED you to write random junk on a piece of paper, that would eventually be thrown away.  I obviously wasn’t a straight A student.  I mean in elementary years I was, but as soon as I reached my independence in middle school,  I lost everything.  Ability to focus in class, my empathy towards others.  I wasn’t ever really nice to anyone in middle school, or freshman and sophomore year.  But last month that changed.
I met her.
The girl of my dreams.
The one I could make laugh by dropping my pencil in class, or showing her stupid, pointless videos off the internet.  Once I met her, everything sorta came back to me.  I started changing.  I acted kinder towards others, started picking up my grades.  Focused.  Something about her just changed me.  I don’t know if it was her scent.  The scent of flowers, or the way she dressed, always in her jean shorts and short top.  Or if it was her blonde hair, or even her bright blue eyes.  Maybe it was her laugh, of the way she helped me study after school.  The way she made me flashcards, the way she gave me the homework answers.  I don’t know what it was.
Because, it wasn’t one thing.
It was everything about her I liked.  
We were at my house, scrolling through a plethora of videos.  Laughing at all them.  Even if they made no sense.  One said . . .
“How do I clean my toilet with a cheeseburger?” 
Yeah, something that I would have laughed at in kindergarten.  Something I didn’t laugh at.  But her laugh made me laugh.  The way she lied on my chest as I scrolled through videos, holding my arm out in front of her face so she could see.
Life mattered now.
My parents were always harassing me to get a “girlfriend” and I was never interested.  I didn’t feel like putting all my trust into a random person I didn’t even know.  I knew I could easily fumble, or I would get used by that special person.
But when I saw her in the hallway on my way to English third period, I knew I had to try.  My friends even annoyed me about girls.  They all liked someone, and started making matches for me with random girls, to try to help.
Help.
I tried to ignore it, but I also worried about it.  I never went to a school dance with a girl unlike them.  I never went out to lunch, or studied with someone the opposite sex of me.  I was just worried.  I didn’t want to be alone.
I lived in a small town called “Redwood Town”.  It was very basic.  Home to Barry Redwood.  I’ll explain some of this towns history.
Barry Redwood lived from 1823-1860.  His history started off as a young boy, around the age of twelve.  His mother had died when he was five years old, due to an alcohol addiction.  He grew up depressed, with his strict dad.  His dad would make him walk around town in 95 degree weather, going door to door selling newspapers for his new publishing business.  Since his dad was busy with work, and made him work also, he grew up alone and imprisoned under his father’s wrath.  He had no freedom.  When he was alone though, he would practice his math problems.  He would sit at his desk every time he was free and alone and practice his math problems.  Math cured his mind.  He was the top mathematician at school, and was dedicated to that role.
His dad was not supportive of it at all.
“ITS A WASTE OF TIME WRITING NUMBERS ON PAPER!”
“THIS WILL NOT FLY IN THIS HOUSE!”
“YOU ARE GOING TO WORK FOR MY BUSINESS!”
Barry ignored his father.  
At least I don’t need to type fake news stories on my typewriter seven hours a day, trying to start drama in town.  Maybe cause a riot.  Maybe bring everyone apart.  Whatever my stupid bean-sized mind had in plan. Barry would think to himself.  
One day, he decided to run away.  
No one really knows what happened to him.  Some say he took his life, or got lost trying to find “the perfect life”, but other theories say he did find “the perfect life”, and lived inside a tiny house on the beach, by the glistening, sparkling ocean.
I was sorta like Barry before I met her.  Anna.  The girl of my dreams.  And now look where we were.  I was doing better at life, and she was happy.",@Thrillixvids,0,2026-01-21T07:15:39Z,youtube

They gave weak excuses for every single thing he did wrong. At that point, there wasn’t even anything to redeem, because there was just a convenient excuse for everything. Torturing a child? A hologram. Killing someone? He was abusive. Holding the MC prisoner, sexually harassing her, and at one point pinning her to a wall and kissing her?

Books that deserve more hate #booktok #booktube #bookish #bookreview #books #reading #booksummary,"I started getting annoyed with these books the minute my husband (middle school English teacher) came home and told me one of his young female students was reading Icebreaker in his class. Her mom didn't care. And the student in question had new smut she was reading in school every other week. Likely out of her mother's collection. Because TikTok and social media are influencing these kids to read these books. His school has already had problems that arose from these books that became so severe kids aren't allowed to bring their own books to school and if they want to read it has to be something they check out of the school library. Students have been caught literally acting out scenes in the books in the school. Or abusing their friend or bf/gf because they want to be more like characters in the books they are reading. My husband is literally thinking about quitting his job because he can't stand it anymore. These incidents are just the tip of the iceberg especially with TikTok. The challenge are getting out of hand too with these kids. They just had to suspend another kid yesterday because of the ""knockout challenge"".

They need to stop putting these books in these covers that make them also look like they should be in the YA or Middle Grade section. They need to stop pushing them on children. They need to stop romanticizing abuse and SA. It needs to be shelved appropriately. Children shouldn't even be allowed to buy them when they card for explicit video games and movies and even music. I don't care what adults read as long as they aren't acting like idiots and treating the content like it's a positive.

Reading comprehension and media literacy is in the toilet and we need to start protecting kids from this garbage.

These stupid and lazy cartoony covers are making things worse. There's a reason covers for different books used to looks a certain way. You could usually tell just by looking what kind of book it is and who it was geared towards. You can't anymore. And kids are suffering because of it.",@SetsunaMeiou-SailorPluto,0,2026-01-14T15:37:18Z,youtube

Books that deserve more hate #booktok #booktube #bookish #bookreview #books #reading #booksummary,The ppl who are all don’t read. WELL DUHH IM NOT READING. Romance is so annoying these days. I can’t find anything without a (often weirdly placed) sex scene. It’s infuriating. Like I’m thinking of just digging into classical fiction or stay on kids books because sex don’t make you’re book cooler okay??? And abuse and toxicity should not be glamorized. And even if it’s a coping method it’s a VERY unhealthy one. I genuinely don’t blame people my age who just prefer TV shows and Video Games to books. There is so much shit on the market and in high demand too. Meanwhile actually good things don’t get published because big publishers are just looking for what makes the customer happy. And apparently what makes the customer happy is absolutely shit.,@LunariaLunaRosemary,0,2026-01-08T23:07:02Z,youtube

5 Books Every Book Bro Needs To Read!,"I would go with the following in no particular order...

Red Rising
*And I agree the first book is thoroughly mediocre but damn does the series take off in amazing ways in Golden Son et al.

Butcher's Crossing

I never imagined a western could be done without cowboys and native americans but William's pulls it off spectacularly and with some of the most evocative nature descriptions you will ever read.

The Hobbit

It is basically the perfect book as far as I am concerned even if it is one of the most known works in the english language.

Starship Troopers

Heinlein is perhaps the best SciFi author of two generations and the novel will cause you to ponder your thoughts on a person's role and obligations within society. Given how much we focus (in America at least) on what our rights are and what we are entitled too I think it is worth to ask.....what do I owe to society? And this book will demand that from you.

The Promise by Ann Weisgarber

This is my kind of love story. It's gritty, it's messy and it comes with more unideal strings attached than you might like. A well to do Catherine Wainwright is forced by circumstance to accept a marriage proposal from a former suitor. She leaves the uppercrust of early 1900s Dayton, OH and makes her way to Galveston where he new husband owns a reasonably successful dairy farm. It is set against the backdrop of one of the most devastating storms to ever hit the gulf coast.",@austinduke8876,0,2025-10-11T16:41:26Z,youtube

Gunaho ka Devta #books #bookreview #booktube #bookstagram #booklovers #gunahonkadevta #hindi,chandar was always in dillema between the idea of love and sex. ignoring the individuality of sudha's pure and immense love - he tried to mend his beliefs to genralization of women and as to what suited him. he fell off his own firm beliefs and regained them only after the heartwretching event of sudha's death. to atone for his sins the good deed he the devta does was to fulfill sudha's last wish by marrying binti.,@taru6,0,2025-08-21T08:05:29Z,youtube

If you are here, then what is your real purpose?
What should you do to live a good and peaceful life?
And after all, how long will you stay here — seventy years at most?
Then what will happen to your body after death?
Where will you go?
And how long will that next life be compared to this short worldly life?
What will that life be like?

5 EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BOOKS for your 20s! | Ankur Warikoo #shorts,"I’m 20, from a lower middle-class family. Mere aas paas ke log ek normal life chahte hain – govt job, shaadi, settle. But mera mindset alag hai. Mujhe casual life nahi jeeni. Mera dream hai ki main ek extraordinary life jeeyu – jahan fame aur money dono ho.

Mere paas knowledge bhi hai aur passion bhi, par sach batau to ek bada darr bhi hai – ki kahin main padhai aur skills dono me mehnat karu, par aakhir me jo chahta hoon wo achieve hi na kar pau.

Abhi confuse hoon – kya main safe route choose karu (sirf government job ki preparation) ya risk lekar apna passion follow karu (content creation, skills build karna)? Dar yeh hai ki kahi study ko ignore karke future spoil na kar du, aur risk lekar regret na karu.

Main chahata hoon ki jab future me piche mudkar dekhu to yeh feel na ho ki ""ye karna tha, par maine nahi kiya.""

Agar aap meri age me hote to aap kya choose karte? Passion follow karna ya safe side rehna? Mujhe real experience aur guidance chahiye 🙏",@NARUTO-n4q6g,0,2025-09-12T08:13:39Z,youtube

Didn’t know Edward was a certified yapper #twilight #booktube #bookreview #dayinmylife,I found his book annoying! Like a 5 second action was described so dramatically and longer then it should have been! It felt like he was going back and looking at himself in time and explaining what he was thinking and doing! It wasn't a book that was in the moment!!!! SERIOUSLY DRAINING!!!,@winnyhoward1412,0,2026-01-23T07:04:54Z,youtube
