read RECOMMENDATIONS!✨📚 #minivlog #bookrecommendations,"Will surely read some of the books you recommend! I recently read the novel ""Allah Miyan ka Karkhana"" by Mohsin Khan, the latest sensation in the literary scenario.  

I sincerely request the you to review this novel, which is available in Hindi, as as I read will come soon in 60 languages including one in English by Harper Collins in English. As I'm interested in reading it in English. You can review it better than me and most i know. The novel has recently been honored with the Bank of Baroda Rashtrabhasha Samman and published by Rekhta.  

Critics have described it as a “mirror” that reflects society’s harsh truths. It poignantly portrays how innocence, especially that of children, is punished, and how injustice against the defenseless continues to thrive. The work raises profound moral and social questions that resonate deeply with our times.  

Your review of this novel would be invaluable for literature lovers and offer viewers a fresh perspective.

read RECOMMENDATIONS!✨📚 #minivlog #bookrecommendations,"my recs

 if someone wants to get into reading and loves cdramas, read ann liang's books! you'll fall in love!

if you want to read mythology + fiction, then the hidden hindu trilogy by akshat gupta is perfect

if you want to read suspense, read the silent patient, the plot is crazy

if you want to read something related to self harm or rape, read the way i used to be (shows how being raped by someone close and not getting correct environment to discuss it with loved ones can change) also read girl in pieces",@golden-peach-almond,0,2025-12-07T20:00:12Z,youtube

read RECOMMENDATIONS!✨📚 #minivlog #bookrecommendations,"Pls read before selecting books as a  beginner :

Scratch this, if you want to get into reading try with small adventure books with a good storyline so you don't get bored and stop reading after a while and start feeling miserable... Later you can slowly explore different genres and authors...I would never recommend you to straight away start non-fiction until you find your preferred genre in books that you can truly enjoy. 

Trust me I started my reading journey with books as simple as Thea Stilton series, Enid Blyton , and Nancy Drew , and now have transformed into a voracious reader of books like A thousand splendid suns, the girl who knew too much , A litte life,kite runner, girl in pieces , Tuesdays with Morrie ,or the colour of water by James McBride, All having equally different and engaging stories. 
 
Thanks for Reading, I hope you find good books to read ❤",@starfish_jellybean28,3,2025-11-24T12:24:22Z,youtube

I’m currently writing a book that is around 20% complete and planned for release on Amazon within the next 9–12 months.

Books that deserve more hate #booktok #booktube #bookish #bookreview #books #reading #booksummary,I miss when love and romance wasn’t ’I really want to get in her pants but alas that’s in chapter 14’. Like I get that there may be some lust but I seriously just want a romance that’s a meet cute and silly little dates and healthy relationships and just something adorable.,@LunariaLunaRosemary,0,2026-01-08T23:11:08Z,youtube
Books that deserve more hate #booktok #booktube #bookish #bookreview #books #reading #booksummary,The ppl who are all don’t read. WELL DUHH IM NOT READING. Romance is so annoying these days. I can’t find anything without a (often weirdly placed) sex scene. It’s infuriating. Like I’m thinking of just digging into classical fiction or stay on kids books because sex don’t make you’re book cooler okay??? And abuse and toxicity should not be glamorized. And even if it’s a coping method it’s a VERY unhealthy one. I genuinely don’t blame people my age who just prefer TV shows and Video Games to books. There is so much shit on the market and in high demand too. Meanwhile actually good things don’t get published because big publishers are just looking for what makes the customer happy. And apparently what makes the customer happy is absolutely shit.,@LunariaLunaRosemary,0,2026-01-08T23:07:02Z,youtube

Books that deserve more hate #booktok #booktube #bookish #bookreview #books #reading #booksummary,Stroke of Midnight by K. Webster. Age gap “romance” where the guy is a knockoff Christian Guy coupled with the female lead’s icky step brothers who try to gang r*pe her the entire book all the while her dad just remains blindsided throughout. The book also ends on a cliffhanger and I was immediately like “HELL F*CKING NO!”,@laurencovington5491,0,2026-01-07T17:02:22Z,youtube
