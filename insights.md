📘 Market Insights from Book Consumer Sentiment Analysis

This document presents key insights derived from sentiment analysis performed on book-related consumer comments collected from online platforms during Milestone 2. The objective is to understand reader preferences, common complaints, and overall market trends in the book domain.

📉 Top Consumer Complaints

Negative sentiment analysis indicates that the most frequent complaints are related to:
Book recommendations not matching expectations, where readers felt the content was boring or not useful.
Print and physical quality issues, including complaints about page quality and binding.
Mismatch between hype and actual content, especially for popular self-help and trending books.
Some users also expressed dissatisfaction with repetitive content in motivational books and lack of originality in certain authors’ writing styles.

📈 Positive Market Trends

Positive sentiment records highlight strong appreciation for:
Inspirational and self-development books, such as productivity and habit-building topics.
Classic literature and mythology-based books, including references to traditional epics and well-known stories.
Engaging storytelling and emotional connection, where readers felt personally motivated or entertained.
These trends suggest strong interest in meaningful content that either improves personal growth or provides deep storytelling experiences.

⚠️ Observed Misclassifications

Manual review revealed that:
Some sarcastic or mixed-opinion comments were classified as neutral.
Short or vague comments were sometimes difficult for the model to classify correctly.
Certain recommendation requests were labeled as neutral even though they reflected positive intent.
These errors are expected in LLM-based zero-shot sentiment analysis and can be improved using domain-specific fine-tuning or aspect-based sentiment modeling.

✅ Conclusion

The sentiment analysis provides useful insights into reader behavior and preferences in the book market. While the model effectively captures major sentiment trends, future improvements can include better topic segmentation, genre-wise sentiment comparison, and deeper author-level analysis to strengthen market intelligence outcomes.
